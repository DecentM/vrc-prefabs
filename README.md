# DecentM.Prefabs

This is a collection of UdonSharp prefabs and scripts I made over time for my own use.
I decided to package some of them up and release them, as they've been generally useful, and can save some pain/discomfort (depending on how you look at programming).

## Collections

These scripts are a set of common collection reimplementations using only interfaces available in Udon.
Among others, you'll find a List class here that mimics the interface of `System.Collections.Lists` - no more array math!
